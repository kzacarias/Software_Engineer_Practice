Readme for Example Java of an Event Queue


Event Class: This represents a generic event. Here, it's just a wrapper around a string description, but in a real-world scenario, it
could contain a wide range of data relevant to the event, such as type, source, time, and other context-specific information.



EventQueue Class: This manages the queue of events. It provides methods to enqueue new events (enqueue) and to process all events (processEvents). 
The processing here is sequential and simple for demonstration purposes. The LinkedList is used as the implementation of the Queue interface in 
Java, providing efficient handling of elements.



EventQueueDemo Class: This is a simple demonstration of enqueuing and processing events. It creates an instance of EventQueue, 
adds some Event objects to it, and then processes the events.
