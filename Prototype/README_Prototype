Here is the source I took it from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcFhITC9v0E&ab_channel=Geekific

Here is the link to there repository to see the example code about the burger: https://github.com/geekific-official/geekific-youtube/

1. Remember it is used when we are not able to access the private attributes and it has a lot of attributes

For reference, here is some notable code from the reposity YT channel that should be noted 
1. Well tbh implementing the prototype code is dificult. One thing that is notable is that the Prototype class is an interface. 
2. A concrete class, is a just a class that implements all the methods that it is using. Basically not wasting any class it has. 

For reference, if you are looking at Factoring Guru
1. Basically same thing as the vid. 
 
Similarity between both: 
1. They have interfaces for the prototype and have this client class that has a relationship with the interface. Specifically Aggregation... look at the UML diagram to see the Aggregation relationship.
